## Welcome to the_lotus_git! ðŸŒ·

Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast with a vibrant personality, known for my quirky and cheerful nature.  
Iâ€™m always down for a cold-brew coffee, an iced tea, or a good masal dosa. (I'd be real kushi about it!)  

As someone who learns quickly and never backs down from a challenge, Iâ€™m always seeking ways to infuse excitement into my life through both my unique traits and everyday efforts.  
In my professional role as an ai/ml engineer, Iâ€™m diving deep into research and the fascinating world of ai.  

Feel free to connect with me for collaborations, insights, opportunities, or just a chat about all things tech! [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamalamsivakumar/)
